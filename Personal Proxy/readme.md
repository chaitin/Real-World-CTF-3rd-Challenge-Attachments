To access the internet I setup a personal socks proxy using open-source software, and a tunnel with strong password is used to make it secure.

Here is my proxy config file and a network traffic captured when uploading my secret file to personal storage center. I do not believe anyone could read those encrypted bytes.

Proxy server hosted at 13.52.88.46:50000
